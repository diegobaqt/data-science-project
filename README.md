# Data Science Project

This implementation maps the data from the dataser available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ledysmai5/critically-ill-pediatric-patients-in-picucsv?resource=download%2FgM0NITekPoDUmoG2XhLb%2Fversions%2FIbu03nlU8GW1tUuDb8m9%2Ffiles%2Fcritically+ill+pediatric+patients+in+PICU.csv

SQL Server (SQL) and MongoDB (NoSQL) were used for the implementation. For both, two objects (entities, for SQL), Patient and VitalSigns, were modeled.
